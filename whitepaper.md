# 1. Vision
As quantum computing technology advances, traditional cryptographic methods used in current blockchain infrastructures face unprecedented risks. LATTICE (LAT) is born from the necessity to explore and implement "Post-Quantum Cryptography" (PQC) within the Base ecosystem. Our mission is to build a resilient community that prioritizes long-term security against future decryption threats.

### 2. The Quantum Threat
Most existing blockchains rely on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). While secure today, quantum algorithms (like Shor's algorithm) could theoretically crack these codes. LATTICE focuses on:
* **Awareness:** Educating the Base community about quantum risks.
* **Adaptability:** Developing a framework that can transition to lattice-based signatures—one of the most promising quantum-resistant methods.

### 3. Why LATTICE on Base?
By leveraging the scalability of the Base network (Coinbase L2), LATTICE provides a low-cost, high-speed environment to foster the next generation of secure digital assets.

### 4. Tokenomics (Fair Launch)
To ensure maximum decentralization and security from day one:
* **Total Supply:** (1,000,000,000) LAT
* **Launch:** 100% Fair Launch via Ape.store. 
* **Ownership:** Renounced contract to ensure immutability.

### 5. Roadmap
* **Q1 2026:** Initial Deployment & Community Building (Current Phase).
* **Q2 2026:** Integration with Base ecosystem and security audits.
* **Q3 2026:** Research into Lattice-based signature implementation.
* **Q4 2026:** Strategic
