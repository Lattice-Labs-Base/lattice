### 🛡️ Development Progress Note (Feb 2026)
As of today, we have officially moved from **Stage 5** to **Stage 6**. 
The VERA Protocol v1.2 has passed all rigorous "Stress Tests" on the Remix environment, proving that the sovereign logic is impenetrable to unauthorized signature attempts. We are now preparing for the historical deployment on the Base Testnet.
